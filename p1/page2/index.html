    <p>In life, the number of  ██████████████████████████ beginnings  █████████████ is exactly equal to the number of  ██████████████ endings: ████████████████████ no one has ███████████ yet to begin ██████████ a life who will not █████████ end it. <br><br>
        Now ██████████████████████████ here is something really interesting (to me), ████████████████████████ something you can ███████████ use at ███████████████████ a standing-up-only party when ███████████ everyone is tired of ████  hearing █████████████ there are one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the Esimo ███████ for snow. █████████████████████ This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: ██████████████ Some ███████████ languages are so constructed ████████ English among them █████ that we each ███████ only really speak one sentence ███████ in our lifetime. ███████████ That sentence begins ███ with your first words, ██████  toddling █████████████ around the kitchen,████████  and ends with ███████████████████ your last words right before you step ██████████████ into the limousine, ███████████ or in ███████████████████████ a nursing home, █████████ the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. ████ Or, ██████████████  if you are blessed, ████████████ they are heard ███ by someone who ███████ knows you and loves you █████ and will be sorry to hear ███████████ the sentence end.  <br><br>
        
        When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated.  <br><br>
        
        You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other.  <br><br>
        
        Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other, not you to them or they to you.  <br><br>
        
        I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across ages, across cultures, across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered that first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated, and that last lines are remarkably similar, even repeated. Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, because the words belong to completely different poems. And I began to realize, reading these first and last lines, that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each speak but also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, by those we listen to. And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same: in poem after poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear as children repeated night after night, like a refrain: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now. And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on earth: I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now.  <br><br>
        
        But it is growing damp and I must go in. Memory’s fog is rising. Among Emily Dickinson’s last words (in a letter). A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in, homebound, cloistered, spoke as if she had been out, exploring the earth, her whole life, and it was finally time to go in. And it was.

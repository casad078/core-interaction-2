            <p>healing wounds is a collection of collaged images that imagines a installational art project, calling attention to the unused and broken as a space for reanimation. 
            <br><br>
            The project aquires everyday areas that are forgotten and ignored because of their presence as broken, damaged, and unused. These spaces are than filled with seeds that produce plant and flowerbed systems, ones that now inhabit the unsued area. In doing so, three conditions are being imposed;
            <br><br>
           a. It now draws attention to the broken and unused object/space.
            <br><br>
          b.  It gives back beauty and purpose to the object (i.e., housing plants).
            <br><br>
          c.  It forces the direct interaction between people and unsused space, where the viewer must now either step around and through the installation. It also forces the direct removal of these objects, which in turn acts as an act of maintenance on the damaged object. 
            <br><br>
            The designer would like to point out that the discourse this creates is a more somber one. The use of plants as opposed to other considered objects, like paper or wood chippings, is an intentional choice within the interest of nature after death. The concept explains that nature was here long before humans, and will continue to be here long after humans have gone. By adding nature back into these spaces left behind by humans, it speeds up a process that in actuality, a person would be unable to see.
            <br><br><br>
            The project invites others to participate; find any space that is ignored and overlooked because of it's damage or disuse, and fill it with some sort of material that forces bypasseres to acknowledge it.
